# SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING (SLAM)

This repo contains the code developed through my master's dissertation (avaiable [here](https://github.com/wvmcastro/dissertacao-mestrado/blob/main/tese.pdf), for portuguese readers). It has ROS compatible implementations for **EKF-SLAM**, **EIF-SLAM** and **SEIF-SLAM**, the later being my main object of study in scenarios with more than one robot (distributed and descentralized SLAM).

## Demonstration

### EKF-SLAM and EIF-SLAM
In this comparison video the robot was teleoperated in gazebo and the control inputs were recorded in a rosbag file, then both EKF-SLAM and EIF-SLAM algorithms were both fed with these inputs.
