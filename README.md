# SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING (SLAM)

This repo contains the code developed through my master's dissertation (avaiable [here](https://github.com/wvmcastro/dissertacao-mestrado/blob/main/tese.pdf), for portuguese readers). It has implementations for EKF-SLAM, EIF-SLAM and SEIF-SLAM, the later being my main object of study in scenarios with more than one robot (distributed and descentralized SLAM).
